                            Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
                            The implementation of Python was started in the December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
                            In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
                            In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like: lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
                            Python 2.0 added new features like: list comprehensions, garbage collection system.
                            On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify fundamental flaw of the language.
                            ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with Amoeba Operating System.
                            Python is influenced by following programming languages:
                            ABC language.
                            What can Python do?
                            Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
                            Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
                            Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
                            Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
                            Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development
                            Python is a programming language.

                        <p>
                            The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of java starts with Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.
                            The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted and Dynamic".<h3>James Gosling - founder of java</h3>
                            Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, 
                            etc. There are given the significant points that describe the history of Java.
                            
                            Java History from Oak to Java
                            
                            1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.
                            
                            2) Originally designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.
                            
                            3) Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and file extension was .gt.

                        <p>
                           This chapter discusses a brief history of HTML language. Reading this will help you to get an idea of how HTML has been evolved through the years.

                           Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of HTML, used to work in the computer section of the CERN (European Laboratory for Particle Physics) at Geneva, Switzerland.
                           CERN is an institution for researching particle physics which requires the collaboration of physicists all over the world.

                           Tim has an idea of creating something which would enable physicists to share research information from anywhere in the world, and he came with HTML which can contain links of many documents from one document.

                           Tim's prototype Web browser on the NeXT computer came out in 1990.

                           In 1991, an open discussion group HTML-talk was started across the internet for the development of HTML.
                           In 1992, Dave Raggett from Hewlett-Packard's Labs in Bristol, England who was one of the enthusiastic of HTML, met Tim and upon returning England, Dave wrote a richer version of HTML called HTML+.
                           In 1992, NCSA showed interest in web and contributed to take the development of web a step further.
                           In december 1992, Marc Andreessen of Mosaic team (an early web browser) introduced img tag in the HTML document.
                           March 1993: Lou Montulli releases the Lynx browser version 2.0a.
                           Early 1993: Dave Raggett begins to write his own browser.
